--------------------------------------------------OPENING OF A HTML DOCUMENT :--------------------------------------------------

-- <!DOCTYPE html> = defines the type of the document
-- <html> = starting tag of a html document
-- <head> = contains information of the document
-- <title> = The title for the webpage
-- <body> = inside the <body> tag lies all hte contents of the html file
-- </TAG NAME> = putting a / before any tag closes the tag
-- Basic html opening structure :
                 <!DOCTYPE html>
                 <html>
                 <head>
                 <title>This is the title of the Document</title>
                 </head>
                 <body>
                 <h1>This is a heading</h1>
                 <p>Document content goes here.....</p>
                 </body>
                 </html>

-------------------------------------------------TAGS INSIDE THE BODY :--------------------------------------------------

-- "<h1><h2><h3><h4><h5><h6>" = -heading TAGS
                               -<h6>is smaller than<h2>
-- "<p>" = The <p>(paragraph tag) is used for straucturing our paragraphs
-- "Lorem ipsum" = this is dummy text used to fill up spaces where there will be text.
-- "<br>" = the <br> tag breaks a line in between paragraphs.
             - the <br> tag doesn't have a closing tag
          ex : code :<p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,
               <br>sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. </p>
               *result:
               Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,
               sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
-- "<hr>" = The <hr> tag creates a horizontal line between the content above and the below the <hr> tag.
-- "<pre>"= everything that is written <pre> tag will be displayed the same way it is written in the text editor.
            -the font and font size are the same as in the text editor
            ex :
             <pre>
               hi
               hello world
               my first code
             </pre>
           *result :
           hi
           hello world
           my first code

           *without <pre> tag :
             *result :
          hi hello world my first code
-- "&nbsp;" = Suppose you want to use the phrase "12 Angry Men."
              Here, you would not want a browser to split the "12, Angry" and "Men" across two lines
              In cases, where you do not want the client browser to break text, you should use a nonbreaking space entity &nbsp; instead of a normal space.
              For example, when coding the "12 Angry Men" in a paragraph, you should use something similar to the following code:
              <p>An example of this technique appears in the movie "12&nbsp;Angry&nbsp;Men."</p>

----------------------------HTML Tag vs. Element------------------------------------
 -An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag.
      -For example, <p> is starting tag of a paragraph and </p> is closing tag of the same paragraph but
      -<p>This is paragraph</p> is a paragraph element.

--------------------------- HTML â€“ ATTRIBUTES-----------------------------
  - The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identify any element within an HTML page.
  - The id of an element can be used to insert the Element in the CSS code to style the contents within the specified id
   - ex :<div id="comment-box"></div>
- The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element. They syntax for the title attribute is similar as explained for id attribute:
- The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class of element.

---------------------------The style Attribute---------------------------
 - The style attribute allows you to write css code within the html document by writing the css code withing <style></style>.
  - you can also edit a particular tag by adding style next to its element
    ex : <p style="font-family:arial; color:#FF0000;">Lorem ipsum</p>

-------------------------Generic Attributes :-------------------------
