What is variable (var) ?
variable is a like a container , in which we can we can store a value to use it over and over again in our code instead of writing the value every time we have to use it.

--Different types of javascript data types
- Number    : floating point numbers, for decimals and integers.
- string    : sequence of characters, used for text
- boolean   : logical data type that can only be true or false
- undefined : Data type of a variable that does not have a value yet
- null      : also means "non-existent"

--Javascript has dynamic typing in which data types are automatically assigned to variables.
